A package to make recurring calendar events a little easier

    package: years, months, weeks, days, weekdays, quarters, semesters etc.  
  * Represent dates in terms of their relations to one
    another, such as the "third Friday of July" or the "last Thursday in August".  
  * Specify ranges of dates, such as "after the first Monday 
    in July" but "before the last weekday of August".  
  * Compose the above elements together in arbitrarily complex patterns.
