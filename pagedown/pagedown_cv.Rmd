### Market Betas on the JSE: Market Segmentation, Estimation & Empirical Evaluation

MCom Dissertation Topic at the University of Cape Town

N/A

2015 - 2017

**Supervisor: Kanshukan Rajaratnam**

This dissertation was submitted as my M.Com (Finance) degree requirement at the
University of Cape Town (UCT) and as such it is available online from UCT Libraries
under their open access policy.

The dissertation uses **statistical methods** and in particular **Factor Models** 
to:

  - Discover variables that can be used as predictors of investment return.  
  - Simulate and compare a large number of trading strategies.  
  - Conduct testing to make models more robust and consistent.  
  - Monitor model performance over time.  
  - Correct for errors and changes that arise in model specification.  

These can be applied to:

 - The analysis of quantitative data in other fields. 
 - Gain a deeper understanding of other financial markets and industries.  
 
The process of writing a dissertation has meant I have skills:
Learning new concepts quickly.

  - Conducting research in a way that is comprehensive and detailed.  
  - Writing reports that are clear and authoritative.  
  - Reading and summarising large amounts of information in a short time.  
  - Managing time and meeting deadlines.
