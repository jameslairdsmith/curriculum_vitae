   where we estimate how likely each of our customers are to renew their 
   subscriptions.
*  As part of our product strategy I undertook a project to attribute value
   to our various product categories. This involved determining how much
   monetary value and engagement power is generated by each part of our digital 
   real-estate.
*  I have performed scenario modeling on a number of proposed product and 
   commercial changes to determine their potential effect on advertising and
   subscription revenue.
*  I've been involved in training other members of staff in how to use R.

Before moving to the Data Science team, I was a Data Analyst working as part of

### R

Level: Advanced

N/A

2014 - (present)

I've been using R for many years now and so I think it's worth providing a bit
of detail on some of the skills I have gained.

::: aside
R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical 
computing and graphics
:::

#### Package development

I've developed many R packages of various levels of complexity and so I am
very comfortable with the package development work-flow. This includes set-up,
documentation and unit-testing.

Package development has also given me competence with R's object orientated 
system, in particular with S3.

#### Performance optimisation

While developing R packages, I've learned how to make R code more
performant by using techniques such as microbenchmarking and tools like
profvis.

#### Data visualisation

I've contributed extensively to the the FT's internally built ggplot2 theme,
which is called ftplottools. In doing so, I've added extra options to customise
placement of plot components and to make text rendering more accessible.

#### Automation

While at the FT, I've deployed various automated models and processes. For 
example, We have many statistical and machine learning models that are 
deployed to run on RStudio Connect. We also monitor the health of our code
by integrating with CI tools, namely Circle CI and Github Actions.

### SQL

Level: Advanced

N/A 

2014 - (present)

::: aside
SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for 
managing data held in a relational database management system.
:::

I've been using SQL for many years now and am completely comfortable with all
elements of the syntax. This includes advanced topics such as query 
optimisation. The dialect that I have worked with most is *BigQuery's*
standard syntax, but I have also used *Redshift* and *MS SQL Server*.

While at the FT, I have contributed to our own internal SQL style guide to help
standardise good style practices across the business.

### Vega-Lite (in JavaScript)

Level: Intermediate

N/A 

2019 - (present)

I've created and published several charts using Vega-Lite. They can be
viewed on my website under www.jameslairdsmith.com/charts/.

::: aside
Vega-Lite is a high-level grammar of interactive graphics with both JSON
and JavaScript APIs.

### A study of total beta specification through symmetric regression: the case of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange

Environ Syst Decis (2016) 36: 114

N/A

Jun 2016

**Laird-Smith, J.**, Meyer, K. & Rajaratnam, K.

This journal article is a modified form of the project I completed in the final 
year of my undergraduate degree. The research examines the need for new 
methodology and specification for the CAPM beta parameter on the Johannesburg 
Stock Exchange (JSE). It is available through the Springer online portal.

### Market Betas on the JSE: Market Segmentation, Estimation & Empirical Evaluation

MCom Dissertation Topic at the University of Cape Town

N/A

2015 - 2017

**Supervisor: Kanshukan Rajaratnam**

This dissertation was submitted as my M.Com (Finance) degree requirement at the
University of Cape Town (UCT) and as such it is available online from UCT 
Libraries under their open access policy.

The dissertation uses **statistical methods** and in particular **Factor Models** 
to:

  - Discover variables that can be used as predictors of investment return.  
  - Simulate and compare a large number of trading strategies.  
  - Conduct testing to make models more robust and consistent.  

<!-- These can be applied to: -->

<!--  - The analysis of quantitative data in other fields.  -->
<!--  - Gain a deeper understanding of other financial markets and industries.   -->

<!-- The process of writing a dissertation has meant I have skills: -->
<!-- Learning new concepts quickly. -->

<!--   - Conducting research in a way that is comprehensive and detailed.   -->
<!--   - Writing reports that are clear and authoritative.   -->
<!--   - Reading and summarising large amounts of information in a short time.   -->
<!--   - Managing time and meeting deadlines.  -->

### **gs**

Author and maintainer

N/A

Nov 2018 - (present)

A package to make recurring calendar events a little easier 
by providing a simple grammar for expressing them using R code.
The package includes functions to:  

  * Represent all kinds of date elements found in the `lubridate`
    package: years, months, weeks, days, weekdays, quarters, semesters etc.  
  * Represent dates in terms of their relations to one
    another, such as the "third Friday of July" or the "last Thursday in August".  
  * Specify ranges of dates, such as "after the first Monday 
    in July" but "before the last weekday of August".  
  * Compose the above elements together in arbitrarily complex patterns.
